Improve by
Threshold tuning:
If you want fewer false alarms (false positives), you can slightly adjust the classification threshold.
Compare models:
Plot ROC curves for other models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, SVM) and compare AUC values.

Calibration:
Consider probability calibration (CalibratedClassifierCV) to ensure confidence scores match reality.
